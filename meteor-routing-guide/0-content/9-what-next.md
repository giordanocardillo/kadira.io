We've just covered some major topics related to routing and data management. FlowRouter and other related packages have more functionalities than we just mentioned. So, we suggest you to refer documentation of each of those projects.

* [FlowRouter Documentation](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router)
* [BlazeLayout Documentation](https://github.com/kadirahq/blaze-layout)
* [ReactLayout Documentation](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-react-layout)

If you got any issues, first try to search [Meteor Forums](https://forums.meteor.com/), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) or [FlowRouter issue list](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router/issues). Then, if you can't find an exiting issue, just [open](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router/issues/new) an issue with your problem.

> We are also working on FlowRouter 3.0 which brings Server Side Rendering to Meteor. Have a look at FlowRouter's [ssr](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router/tree/ssr) branch for more information.
