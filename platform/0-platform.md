## Upcoming Products

### Kadira Remote Debug

With Kadira Remote Debugging, you'll be able to debug production Meteor apps in an end-to-end fashion. For example, suppose one of your customers complains that accessing your app is too slow.

You can start a Kadira Debug session for that customer to see what's really happening and discover the root cause. Your customer does not need to install anything: it works with any browser or Cordova app.

### Kadira Real User Monitoring (RUM)

You can see how your users are using your app across the globe. You can see how much time it takes to load your app and identify slow methods and subscriptions. If you need to inspect those slow clients, you can simply start a Kadira Remote Debugging session and see what's actually going on.

### Kadira Optimize

This is the most important product of the Kadira Platform. We track a lot of things and you are using information provided by Kadira to optimize your app. Basically, you find problems in your app and apply fixes based on that information.

_**What if we could tell you where a problem lies and what the solution is? **_<br/>
That's exactly what **Kadira Optimize** does.
