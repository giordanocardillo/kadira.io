To take a client side profile, you need to use Google Chrome's CPU profiling tool. Watch [this video]() on how to take a CPU profile.

Chrome comes with a built-in CPU profiler. But, our CPU analyzer is much better and easier to understand.

> You can also learn how to use Chrome CPU profile with [this article](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/cpu-profiling).

To use our CPU analyzer, first save Chrome's CPU profiler by clicking the "Save" button on Chrome. See below:

Now visit the Kadira Debug CPU profiling section and load the saved profile.
