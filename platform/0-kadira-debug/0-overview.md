Kadira Debug helps developers see what's really happening inside the Meteor app while they are **developing** it. It shows both server and client activities at once.

## Using Kadira Debug with Your App

* First add [`kadira:debug`](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-debug) into your app: `meteor add kadira:debug`
* Then visit http://debug.kadiraio.com/debug

That's all you have to do. Now you can see what's happening in your app at the same time as you are developing it.
