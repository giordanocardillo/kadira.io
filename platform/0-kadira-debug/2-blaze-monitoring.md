In the **Client Activities** section, Kadira Debug shows different activities performed by **Blaze** and the time they took to be completed.

You can see Blaze activities such as:

* Time spent to create and destroy templates
* Time spent to create and destroy DOM elements 
* Time spent to run helpers, autoruns, and render callbacks

This is helpful for identifying which Blaze templates are destroying and creating frequently, so you can optimize your templates accordingly.
