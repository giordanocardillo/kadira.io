CPU Profiling helps to find out exactly what's happening in the CPU and **track bottlenecks**. With this feature, you can find out which part of the code is **responsible** for the bottleneck.

Kadira Debug comes with a built-in CPU analyzer based on the popular [flamegraphs](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) concept. After you've taken a CPU profile, you can analyze it with Kadira Debug CPU Analyzer.
