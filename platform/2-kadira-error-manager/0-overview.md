Kadira Error Manager can track errors in both your **client and server** without any configurations. You can see both these types of errors under one roof. There, you can filter issues by type such as client errors, server crashes, and so on.

With Kadira Error Manager, you can see the whole context of the errorâ€”it's not just the error stack and the message. So, it's very easy to find the root cause.

For example, let's say your app throws a subscription error. With Kadira Error Manager, you can inspect the whole context of that subscription, including its trace. So it's pretty easy to find the actual problem.

> ## Enabling Kadira Error Manager
>
> Error Manager is integrated into Kadira APM and will automatically start to track errors once your app is connected to [Kadira APM](/platform/kadira-debug/overview).
