CPU profiling helps you to find CPU-intensive functions and packages in your app. Based on those profiles, you can take action to **optimize** your app. CPU profiles are very effective, but unfortunately, they are hard to take and analyze, especially in production.

We solve this problem by providing a simple way to take a profile from your Meteor app using just a **few clicks**. After youâ€™ve taken the profile, you can analyze it without leaving Kadira APM. Our analyzer is very simple and easy to understand, even if you have no experience with CPU profiling.
