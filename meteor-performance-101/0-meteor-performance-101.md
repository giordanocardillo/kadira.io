In the Meteor Performance 101, We'll talk about few **successful** ways to improve the performance of your app. This is a collection of our experience on improving Meteor's performance.

> For an example, we'll show you a simple package which can improve performance of your app a lot. We've seen more than **50% cpu usage reduction** and **fast page loads** results of that package.
