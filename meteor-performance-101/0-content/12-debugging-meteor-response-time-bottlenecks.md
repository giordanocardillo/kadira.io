We all want to build faster Meteor apps. Improving the server-side response time is an important factor in building fast apps. 

In Kadira, we have few tools to help you to debug response time bottlenecks in your app. I will show you how to use them.

This is a case study where we debug a sudden response time increase. Look at the following graph:

**We can see a spike in the response time at the end of the graph.**

So, we can clicked on that spike. Then we'll get a response time distribution like this:

This is the response time histogram for that time. It also shows summary measurements, like median and percentiles.

Here, the median is about **535 milliseconds**. That means 50% of our users had a response time lower than 535 milliseconds. That's good. 

Have a look at the **99th** percentile. It has a huge value. It seems like an outlier and a specific case. 

But interestingly, our **90th and 95th** percentiles are also quite high. That's seems like an issue. So let's investigate:

Here our 90th percentile is 42,429 milliseconds. So we can click on the relevant bin on the histogram to see some traces:

Let's look at one of those traces:

On looking at a trace, it seems like there is a waitTime issue. Actually, this happens when we re-deploy our app. All the subscriptions need to be re-run and that's why there is this issue a very big responseTime in the login method.

> We can also look at the **login** method at that time and find out what's really happened for that as well.


This is how you can use Kadira to debug a response time issue in your app. Depending on your app and the case, the individual steps could change slightly, but this is the process you can use.
