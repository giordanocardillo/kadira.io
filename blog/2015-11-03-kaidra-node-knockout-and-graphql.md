summery: Are you competing in the NodeKnockout 2015? Then this is for you!
---

In the 2013 NodeKnockout, we competed in the Hackathon as [Open Comment Box](https://github.com/arunoda/open-comment-box). We didn't win a prize, but we were in the top 10. In this year, we are so thrilled to sponsor [NodeKnockout](http://www.nodeknockout.com/). We know NodeKnockout is amazing, and that's why we are backing it.

**Why Should You Participate in the Hackathon?**

Everyone knows that it's extremely rare to continue developing an app after the Hackathon. If you do, we salute you. We normally participate in the Hackathon for the following reasons:

* Learn a new technology
* Have fun
* Win!

## Learn A New Technology

Learning a new technology is fun if it's useful. It can be awesome if you have very good learning materials. Here is our suggestion.

[**Try GraphQL**](https://learngraphql.com/)

[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) is an application-level query language you can use instead of REST endpoints. Try our <https://learngraphql.com> to learn GraphQL in less than two hours. 

The best thing is that GraphQL doesnâ€™t force you to do anything. You can put it on top of your existing schemas and data sources. You can use it with whichever transport you are familiar with, or you can use it with your familiar front-end technology.

All you have to do is simply replace REST-related stuff with GraphQL. Here are some sample apps you can take a look at:

* [A React Todo app with a GraphQL backend](https://github.com/kadira-samples/react-graphql-todos)

## Have Fun

Learning and using GraphQL is fun, but don't just take it from me. Here are some [reviews](https://learngraphql.com/reviews) from our GraphQL Course:
You can maximize your fun if you try to build the Hackathon app with GraphQL. 

If you get stuck or need some help, jump into the GraphQL [Slack](https://graphql-slack.herokuapp.com/) and ask questions. The GraphQL community will be happy to answer your questions.

## Win!

NodeKnockout offers lots of [prizes](http://www.nodeknockout.com/prizes). We are sponsoring the grand prize, and we have a special prize for the best app built with GraphQL: **a $1000 gift card of your choice**.

We hope you compete and try to win the grand prize and our **special prize** for GraphQL apps.

Have a great Hackathon!<br/>
Kadira Team.
