[Knotable](http://knotable.com/) is an app that unifies team communication. Knotable team use Kadira to monitor their app’s  performance and track errors.

## What is Knotable?

Knotable helps teams to fix their communation problems, specially when working with distributed teams. Knotable is made up of knotes. Knotes hold ideas, conversations and files. You group knotes into knotepads.

Knotable is available for web, mobile and Chrome. It’s used by enterprise customers such as Oracle, VMWare and Quartz. 

Have a look <http://knotable.com> for more information.

## How does Kadira help Knotable? 

We asked this question from Knotable Product Manager [Angus McLeod](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anguspmcleod). He gave a great answer:

> Kadira makes it extremely easy to set up and maintain a real-time stream of valuable statistics and information about our application.

He also added: 

> We previously tried using Datadog, various AWS products and other custom metrics products. The problem with all of these was that, both our needs and what those products provided were fluid. Maintaining relevant metrics is not the first priority when you have ten other important things to do. 
> 
> **Kadira just works. There is no maintenance.**

## They use Kadira’s Error Manager too

Knotable also uses Kadira’s [Error Manager](https://kadira.io/platform/kadira-error-manager/overview). We asked Angus to tell us about a key occasion where Error Manager helped them. Angus told us about a recent incident:

> We were noticing an increased load on our web servers. But we couldn't find anything suspicious in our own logs. Kadira’s Error Manager showed some exceptions being thrown when the Chrome extension was calling an outdated Meteor method. 

> Then, once the method call had been removed and we had pushed the changes to the Chrome app store, the issues were gone and server load came back to normal.

This was just one case. They have found a lot of issues and they were able to fix them, even before the customers noticed. That’s the beauty of Kadira’s Error Manager. We not only show the error, but the context as well.


## Most useful feature of Kadira

We also asked Angus about what he considered to be the most useful feature of Kadira. He said:

> It depends on the team member. The most important feature for me is the home dashboard. It allows me to instantly see the health of the production servers in real time. This is invaluable.

> For our developers, the most useful feature is probably the error manager.

Knotable’s lead engineer, [Evgeny](https://github.com/eluck), confirms this.
