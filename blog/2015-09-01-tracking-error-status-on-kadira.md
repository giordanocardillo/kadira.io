Here is a common feedback we received from our users:

> Hi, I have a suggestion. It would be great if I could "dismiss" errors or mark them as resolved on my end. This way, I can keep track of which errors I have resolved.

Today we are happy to announce new Kadira feature which allows you to track **status** to errors. With that, you can mark errors as "Ignored", "Fixing" or "Fixed".

Once you mark an error as "Ignored", it will be hidden. 

But you can click on "Show Ignored Errors" checkbox or filter by "ignored" status to view them again.

You can also filter errors by status like this:
