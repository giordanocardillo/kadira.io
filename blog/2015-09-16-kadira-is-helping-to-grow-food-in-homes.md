Actually, we haven’t introduced a new product at Kadira. But we are helping an amazing company that is trying to revolutionize how we think about food and sustainable living.

## Enter Grove Labs

Grove Labs has a very interesting mission: **“To provide people with access to fresh, healthy, locally-grown food”**.

They want to make this dream into a reality. Their in-home gardening appliances, known as Ecosystems, are like a sustainable, mini-farm in your home. These systems utilize aquaponics to grow vegetables, herbs, and small fruits year round in a space the size of a bookshelf.

They are not on a mission to sell Ecosystems to everybody in the world, but rather to inspire a big cultural movement towards sustainable, diversified, and decentralized agriculture. They have delivered over 100 Groves to Early Adopter customers in the Greater Boston Area and are currently taking pre-orders for their next generation product.

## How does Kadira helps Grove Labs?

The Grove Ecosystem has a companion mobile app known as Grove OS. Through this application, users are guided through the growing experience. Grove OS is built on **Meteor** and uses **Kadira** for performance and monitoring. 

We talked to their Lead Software Engineer, Louis DeScioli to learn more about their app and how they use Kadira. This is an excerpt from our interview with Louis.

## How has Kadira been most beneficial to your development?

We asked this question from Luis and this is what he told:

> The **client-side error tracking** has been a big help to us. We only had a couple weeks of time to integrate Grove OS with finished hardware before we delivered to the first customers. 
>
>Kadira helped us pinpoint bugs and squash as we rolled out the deliveries. Delivering as fast as we did with as complex a product, we were bound to have broken spots in the app. With Kadira, we were alerted when our clients did run into errors and would know exactly **where and why**.

We think Grove Labs has a very compelling mission and interesting solution to a very important problem. We are happy to continue to help them with Kadira in making it a reality.
