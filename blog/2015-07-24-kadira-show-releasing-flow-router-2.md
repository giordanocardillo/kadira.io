title: Kadira Show: Releasing Flow Router 2.0 & Beyond That
category: meteor
summery: We are releasing FlowRouter 2.0 and some other related projects on July 29.

We started [FlowRouter](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router) as an internal experiment when we are [rewriting](https://kadira.io/blog/launching-the-new-kadira-ui/) Kadira. We had really no idea whether anyone is going to use it or not. 

But, seems like everyone [like](https://atmospherejs.com/meteorhacks/flow-router) our experiment. Now it's not an experiment anymore. FlowRouter adoption in pretty impressive and that's more than we have anticipated.

Finally, we are ready for the 2.0 release and we have already started initial work for 3.0 which focus on **server side rendering** and page load improvements. 

> Thanks for everyone who submit PRs, issues and try out Flow Router. Without you guys, FlowRouter is just an experiment.
