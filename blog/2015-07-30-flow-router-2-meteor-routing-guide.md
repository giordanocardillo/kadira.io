summery: We've released FlowRouter 2.0 and a routing guide for Meteor apps.
---

After some hard work for more than 6 months, we've [released](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router) FlowRouter 2.0. It's another look at routing for Meteor apps. Thanks everyone who helped us in different ways.

Visit [Flow Router documentation](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router) for more information.

## Meteor Routing Guide

With FlowRouter, writing Meteor apps is bit different from the traditional approach. But, it will lead to better **performance** and **maintainability** or your app. Since this is new to most of the Meteor developers, there are a lot of questions.

So, we created a [guide](https://kadira.io/academy/meteor-routing-guide) with some recommended ways to write Meteor apps with FlowRouter. We think this is the way you organize and build Meteor apps for the Future. That's why, we named it as the [Meteor Routing Guide](https://kadira.io/academy/meteor-routing-guide).

## Other Releases

FlowRouter 2.0 is just another milestone. We've already begun the work for FlowRouter 3.0 which brings [Server Side Rendering](https://kadira.io/blog/meteor-ssr-support-using-flow-router-and-react/) to Meteor apps.

Today, we are happy to release the first alpha of FlowRouer 3.0 (AKA SSR version) and some related projects.

* [FlowRouter SSR version](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/tree/ssr)
* [DocHead](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-dochead) - Isomorphic way to set meta tags and modify `document.head`.
* [Reaktor](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-reaktor) - Another FlowRouter routing syntax for React apps

We also had a release party and you can watch it from here.
