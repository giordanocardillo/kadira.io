## A Gift from Kadira

Since this is a great initiative from MDG, we decided to help in whatever way we can. So we have these gifts for all participants in the Meteor Global Hackathon:

* FREE access to [BulletProof Meteor](https://bulletproofmeteor.com/) Guru Package
* A FREE copy of [Meteor Explained](https://gumroad.com/l/meteor-explained)
* 4 months FULL access to Kadira

Once you have registered for the hackathon, you'll get instructions on how to get these gifts.

## Performance & Hackathon Apps

In a hackathon, we normally do not worry about performance issues. Sometimes, however, at the end when you are getting ready to publish the app, you might find yourself having to deal with such issues. That's not good.

Therefore, it's a good idea to know about performance-related stuff and how Meteor works before you participate in the hackathon. Then you will know what you are doing and can apply performance tweaks as needed.

> You can use our gifts to learn about Meteor internals and optimize your app.

Have a good hackathon and enjoy :)
