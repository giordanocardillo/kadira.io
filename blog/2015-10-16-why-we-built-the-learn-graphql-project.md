summery: This is the back story behind our Learn GraphQL project.

If you have been watching Hacker News closely or are interested in GraphQL, I hope you have already seen our [Learn GraphQL](https://learngraphql.com/) project. This is our story about why we built it and continue to build it.

> Even if you are creating apps with Meteor, you may also need to learn GraphQL sooner or later. So now is the time to [learn GraphQL](https://learngraphql.com/). 

## We(I) hated GraphQL

When the GraphQL [spec](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/) launched back in July, I hated it. I even said so publicly on the [crater.io](https://crater.io/posts/h9NauSSsNeJAcqCMW/react-s-graphql-seems-likes-a-overly-complexed-solution).
 
That was my reaction by just looking at the spec. At that time, it was very hard to find tutorials and there was no official documentation. 

Eventually everyone at Kadira grew to love GraphQL as we learnt to understand it. We now believe that this is the future of APIs. 

## The Learn GraphQL Project

There are already many good tutorials about GraphQL. But we thought that GraphQL deserves much better learning materials (Because, GraphQL is a superb technology) . 

We wanted to build a learning experience for GraphQL whereby someone would say “Wow” by just looking at it. We also wanted it to be simple and easy to follow.

That's how the [Learn GraphQL](https://learngraphql.com/) project was born, and everyone loves it – including the [creators](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/654373305000919040) of [GraphQL](https://twitter.com/GraphQL/status/654075229027762176). 

It's a not just a set of tutorials. It's an interactive learning experience. Just after every key point, you need to answer a question. Sometimes you have to do some tasks using the [learn graphql sandbox](https://sandbox.learngraphql.com/).

> On the launch day, more than 300 developers completed half of the course. That means they are now fluent in GraphQL and they competed tasks we asked them to do.
> 
> We'd like to thank every one of you. We are pretty happy, and we want to create more lessons. 

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. We will develop more lessons and dive into different aspects of GraphQL over the coming weeks. 

We have talked to a few developers and they tend to find [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) a bit complex. So we are experimenting with a GraphQL client that is simple to use. It's not as feature-rich as Relay, but it lets you use GraphQL with any client-side app without much effort. 

GraphQL is just 4 months old now and it's going to have a great future. Let's learn and build GraphQL together.
